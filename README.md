# HOMEPANORAMA

The panorama dashboard should be a solution to overview important information and control automated tasks quickly.

## Intention
Home automation plus tidy and clean design is not often going hand in hand. When you lookup at [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=home+dashboard&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjf4JDPxrrpAhUHyaQKHaLNCPAQ_AUoAXoECAwQAw&biw=1309&bih=717) for “home dashboards”, the solutions and ideas look overwhelming, crowed or not well designed (personal opinion).

With [openhab](https://www.openhab.org/) for example, you can merge devices and services from different companies. The backend provides a lot of functionally. But the frontend [solutions](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/habpanel.html) are not well designed (again, personal opinion) but very customisable related to home automation control.

This project should provide a platform independent solution. I found inspiration on [dribble](https://dribbble.com/9raik/collections/2054777-HomeApp), [medium](https://onezero.medium.com/the-morning-paper-revisited-35b407822494) or in interesting [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZZCZpc0AcY) about design, related to this topic. The problem is, that they are often just design-concepts or limited in there features.

The [Apple Homekit App](https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/de_DE/macos/macos-mojave-ios12-macbook-iphone-x-home-app-notifications-hero-crop.jpg), for example, provides a thoughtful interface but only allows you to control devices and see information about them. If you consider to hang it on your wall as a control-center, you have to buy a very expensive “screen” (so an iPad).

SmartMirrors handle the overview context but are limited with controls (e.g. via Amazon Alexa)

To sum up, the motivation is to create an application that extends the functionally beyond controlling. So integrate as many services (e.g. weather, public-transport, calendar infos) as possible without setting back on the design.

## Goals

My goal and dream is to create an application, were we develop new functionally together and integrate services to one platform. I will mention later some ideas.

### First concept

First of all the idea is to have a touchscreen mounted on the wall (for example in the entrance) to get a quick overview about information or control often use automations.

The advantage of a web-based solution would be to control and overview information on your computer or other device as well e.g. overview your plant sensors from the couch. Furthermore you could use it on a (not used) tablet, raspberry pi with screen etc..

I created a quick first concept to get an idea about the structure idea. The color for this sketch is missing yet.

First concept without colors

### Some ideas

To just name a few for the dashboard:

- Integration of a package tracker: see upcoming deliveries and if “delivery today” show it in your *inbox* = start page (tracking [api](https://extcall.17track.net/de))
- Integration of a plant-overview-board (works with [xiaomi plant sensors](https://de.gearbest.com/other-garden-supplies/pp_373947.html) to get current plant information)
- Integration of scene control: control common scenes like “coming home”, “start cleaning” (e.g. integrate with openhab)
- Integration of public transport information: show upcoming trains or buses: e.g.: create routines for mornings to see schedules (use public transport apis from local city)

*see [Kanbanboard](https://github.com/raikm/homepanorama/projects/2) on Github for more ideas.*

Solutions of this examples exist for sure but they are mostly isolated solutions and are a good start.

### About me

Even though I am about to finish my master degree in medical informatics I feel as a beginner in programming. I had only 50% (felt like even less) programming related topics in my [bachelor](https://www.htwg-konstanz.de/bachelor/gesundheitsinformatik/uebersicht/) and [master](https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/web/en/studies-further-education/medical-informatics-master/) degree. I was mostly working on small scaled projects and in my free time I lost interested to finish personal projects.

Since one year I am passionated about python (writing automation scripts) and web developing. I started with vue.js at the beginning of 2020 and I love it. I am also using it in my current master-thesis to work on a recruitment tool, where medical staff can analyse patient-data to get an overview about potential patients.

Since half a year I finally motivated myself to invest way more time in software developing and my learning curve rises steadily. The topics I am working on every week are web developing (vue.js), [FHIR](https://hl7.org/FHIR/) (standard for health care data exchange) and Python (Django Server impl. in my master thesis).

Please feel also free to leave feedback or new ideas 😊

Maybe there is a solution already and I didn’t see it? Let me know!
